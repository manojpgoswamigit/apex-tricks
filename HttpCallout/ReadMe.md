## Create An Application For the Callout Test

#### Let’s start off with creating the application to run the test. I would like to pull a weather report based on my zip code from an API provided by OpenWeatherMap. 
#### This application will retrieve my zip code’s weather forecast by sending an HTTP request to the API, receiving a response in JSON format, parsing the JSON, 
#### and display the results in a Visualforce page. The first portion of code we will dive into is the Apex class used to actually make the HTTP request. 

#### you will need to do so for the HTTP request to work. To do this go to Setup–>Security Controls–>Remote Site Settings. You will now create a new remote site that has the url set to https://api.openweathermap.org. Let’s move onto creating the Visualforce page.
